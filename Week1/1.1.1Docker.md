You can use **Docker** to build containers that do certain functions. Let's say we want to make a container that runs pipeline, the pipeline is python script. Here's how you can do this:

1. Manually
let's runt he following command:

```docker run -it ubuntu bash```

This command will create an ubuntu container from an image then run **bash** inside it. After finishing the build process you will have ubuntu that has bash running, so you can write your casual bash commands.

```ls```

This will show all files and directories. I want to run command that removes everything from ubuntu:

```rm -rf / --no-preserve-root```

you will notice every this is removed so if you type **ls** or any other command it won't run. now lets exit:

```exit```

Then run ```docker run -it ubuntu bash``` again and type ```ls``` it will show all files again!!

This proves that the container doesn't save the operations and modifications that you make if you turn off the session.
